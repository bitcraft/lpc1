You are Rat, the bounty hunter.
You've arrived at this village after hearing reports of creatures in the area.
These creatures are unlike anything the people have ever seen before.

They are called "the Disorder", and breed and mutate at a supernatural speed.
A few weeks ago a mine just outside the town was opened and released the Disorder.
You have arrived during the day.
The night is not safe.

It has been a few weeks since the disorder escaped from the caves and dispersed.
The towns people know little about them.  Only their screams can be heard.

The town, set in a the mountain, is protected and so far the Disorder have not ventured beyond these peaks.

The first hunter was a local townsman, Ax.
He reasoned that since they waited until night to escape the cave, that they must not like the the sun.
This has been verified since they have not been seen by locals during the day, but their cries can be heard at night.

A week ago Ax left to investigate the caves.
He has not returned.

You first must find the fate the the townsman, Ax.
Then, you may build your camp and find an apprentice.

"""
Since a pyGOAP agent relies on cues from the environment when planning, having
a stable and efficient virtual environment is paramount.  

When coding your game or simulation, you can think of the environment as the
conduit that connects your actors on screen to their simulated thoughts.  This
environment simply provides enough basic information to the agents to work.  It
is up to you to make it useful.

objects should be able to produce actions that would be useful, rather than the
virtual actors knowing eacatly how to use and what to do with other objects.
This concept comes from 'The Sims', where each agent doesn't need to know how
to use every object, but can instead query the object for actions to do with it.

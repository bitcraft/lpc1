"""
These are the building blocks for creating pyGOAP agents that are able to
interact with their environment in a meaningful way.

When actions are updated, they can return a precept for the environment to
process.  The action can emit a sound, sight, or anything else for other
objects to consume.

These classes will be known to an agent, and chosen by the planner as a means
to satisfy the current goal.  They will be instanced and the the agent will
execute the action in some way, one after another.

Actions need to be split into ActionInstances and ActionBuilders.

An ActionInstance's job is to work in a planner and to carry out actions.
A ActionBuilder's job is to query the caller and return a list of suitable
actions for the bb.
